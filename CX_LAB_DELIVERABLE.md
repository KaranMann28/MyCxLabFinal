### 🎯 Channel Priority Matrix

| Channel | AI Citation Potential | Effort | Week 1 Priority |
|---------|----------------------|--------|-----------------|
| **Reddit** | 🔴 40.11% | Medium | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Wikipedia** | 🟠 26.33% | High (hard to edit) | ⭐⭐ |
| **YouTube** | 🟡 23.52% | High | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **LinkedIn** | 🟢 5.90% | Low | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Newsletter** | — | Low | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

**Where to invest first:** Reddit + LinkedIn + Newsletter (90% of Week 1 effort)

---

### 📈 Making Wikipedia Happen

**The challenge:** Wikipedia is 26% of AI citations but notoriously hard to add to.

**Strategy:**
1. **Don't edit Wikipedia directly** — gets flagged as promotional
2. **Get cited by sources Wikipedia trusts:**
   - Academic papers referencing CX Lab data
   - News outlets (TechCrunch, Retail Dive) quoting the research
   - Industry reports (Forrester, Gartner) including the data
3. **Create a Wikipedia-worthy topic:**
   - "E-commerce customer service automation" doesn't have a page
   - Establish CX Lab as the authority before someone creates it
4. **Wait for organic addition:** Once cited by 3+ trusted sources, Wikipedia editors add naturally

---

### 🎬 YouTube Strategy: Transcripts as AI Training Data

**Why YouTube matters:** 23.52% of AI citations come from YouTube transcripts.

**The play:**
1. Create video version of each insight (Descript)
2. Ensure transcript is SEO-optimized (include key phrases)
3. Title format: "CX Lab: [Insight Name] — [Key Stat]"
4. Description: Full text summary + link to CX Lab
5. Chapters: Break into sections for better indexing

**Example transcript optimization:**

```
[0:00] "According to CX Lab research analyzing 285 million support tickets..."
[0:30] "The efficiency multiplier shows a 7x increase in AI-influenced revenue..."
[1:00] "Gorgias data reveals that intelligent AI closes the satisfaction gap..."
```

### 💡 Big Idea: "CX Lab AI Agent"

What if the CX Lab itself had an AI agent that could:
- Answer questions about the data ("What's the AI influence rate for BFCM?")
- Generate custom reports for prospects
- Create on-demand visualizations

**Tool:** Vercel AI SDK + Claude API + CX Lab data layer

**Impact:** Turn passive report into interactive research assistant.

## 🚀 Three Research Ideas for v2

### 1. The Loyalty Inflection Point
At what CSAT score do customers stop coming back?

> *"Tickets below 3.8 have a 47% churn rate."*

### 2. The Reply Time Revenue Curve
Does faster response = higher order value?

> *"Under 5 minutes = 23% higher spend."*

### 3. The Automation Betrayal Index
How many "resolved" AI tickets need human follow-up within 24 hours?

> *"38% of basic AI closures need human rescue. Intelligent AI? Just 12%."*

---

## 🎯 Summary

| Insight | Key Number | Positioning |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| The Efficiency Multiplier | 7x revenue growth | AI drives revenue, not just deflects |
| The AI Satisfaction Gap | 0.8-point gap | Intelligent AI closes it |
| The Quality Flywheel | Rising quality rate | AI rewards investment |

**The narrative:** Automation is inevitable (Ramp agrees). The question is whether you automate with basic bots or intelligent AI. Gorgias is the intelligent choice.

## 📖 DEEP DIVE ARTICLES: The Full Research Experience

### The Request
You wanted a flow that orchestrates the creation of deeper research articles beyond the Quick Take—similar to [Ramp's velocity articles](https://ramp.com/velocity/business-ai-adoption-flatlines).

### What I Built

**New Route:** `/research/:slug`
- `/research/efficiency-multiplier` → Full 8-min read on the 7x revenue multiplier
- `/research/ai-satisfaction-gap` → Full 10-min read on the CSAT gap

**Structure (inspired by Ramp):**
1. **Hero Section** — Date, read time, title, subtitle, author
2. **Table of Contents** — Sticky sidebar navigation
3. **Key Finding** — Highlighted callout with the main stat
4. **Analysis Sections** — What changed, why it matters, who wins
5. **Methodology** — Transparent data sourcing
6. **Action Section** — What should you do?
7. **CTA** — Link to customer case study
8. **Share Buttons** — Twitter/X, LinkedIn

### Claude Prompts for Each Section Type

**Key Finding Section:**
```
You are writing the opening of a research article. Given:
- Main metric: [X]
- Comparison: [Y vs Z]
- Time period: [dates]

Write a 50-word "Key Finding" that:
1. Leads with the most surprising number
2. States what changed
3. Hints at why it matters
4. No em dashes, no "In conclusion"
```

**Analysis Section:**
```
You are writing the analysis section of a CX research article. Given:
- Trend: [description]
- Data: [specific numbers]
- Context: [industry background]

Write a 200-word analysis that:
1. Opens with a strong claim
2. Backs it with 3 specific data points
3. Explains what's driving the trend
4. Ends with "Here's what the data shows:"
```

**Action Section:**
```
You are writing the "What Should You Do?" section. Given:
- Main insight: [summary]
- Target reader: ecommerce merchant

Write 4 action items, each starting with "If you're..." format:
- If you're measuring X: Do Y
- If you're using X: Consider Y
- If you're optimizing X: Reconsider Y
- If you're scaling X: Relax—Y

Keep each item under 40 words. End with a memorable line.
```

### Code: DeepDive.tsx Structure

```typescript
// /src/pages/DeepDive.tsx

### How InsightCard Links to Deep Dives

Each `InsightCard` now has an optional `deepDiveSlug` prop:

```typescript

        content: `For years, support was measured by deflection. How many tickets did we avoid? How fast did we close them? The best support was invisible support.

That playbook is dead.

The brands winning today are flipping the script. They're not trying to minimize support interactions—they're trying to maximize the value of each one.

Here's what the data shows:

**January 2025:** 27.3M tickets, 0.26% revenue influence
**November 2025:** 25.3M tickets, 1.84% revenue influence

Ticket volume dropped, but the tickets that remained became dramatically more valuable. Each interaction is now doing 7x more work.

This isn't about handling fewer tickets. It's about handling the *right* tickets at the *right* moments.`,

What happened to AI influence?

**Pre-BFCM (Oct):** 1.97% influence rate
**Peak BFCM (Nov):** 1.84% influence rate
**Post-BFCM (Dec):** 1.46% influence rate

The influence rate held. It didn't collapse under pressure.

This tells us something important: intelligent AI doesn't break at scale. It maintains its value even when volume explodes. The slight dip during BFCM isn't a failure—it's exactly what you'd expect when checkout-focused traffic dominates. Shoppers at checkout don't need AI. They need speed.

The real insight: AI influence peaks during the consideration phase, not the conversion phase. Brands optimizing AI for the wrong moments are leaving money on the table.`,

**1. They deploy AI at decision points, not just deflection points**
Instead of routing every query to a chatbot, they use AI when customers are uncertain—comparing products, reading reviews, or hesitating at cart. These are the moments where AI creates value.

**2. They measure influence, not deflection**
Deflection rates are a vanity metric. The real question: did this interaction move the customer closer to purchase? Did it increase order value? Did it prevent a return?

**3. They train their AI with context**
Generic chatbots score 3.7 CSAT. Purpose-built AI with product knowledge, order history, and intent detection approaches 4.5. The difference isn't the technology—it's the investment in training.`,

**Revenue influence** is calculated as the percentage of GMV associated with orders that had a support interaction within the 7-day attribution window prior to purchase.

**Ticket volume** includes all customer-initiated support requests across email, chat, social, and voice channels.

**Limitations:**
- Correlation is not causation—support interactions may correlate with purchase intent rather than causing it
- Data represents Gorgias merchants, which may differ from the broader market
- Attribution windows vary by industry; 7 days is a reasonable median

We publish this methodology because transparency builds trust. If you have questions, reach out.`,

**If you're using generic AI:** Consider purpose-built solutions. The CSAT gap between generic and trained AI is 0.8 points—that's the difference between acceptable and excellent.

**If you're optimizing for checkout:** Reconsider. Our data shows AI influence peaks during consideration, not conversion. Move your AI upstream.

**If you're scaling for BFCM:** Relax. Intelligent AI holds steady at scale. The brands that struggle are the ones with undertrained systems, not the ones with high volume.

The efficiency multiplier is real. The question is whether you're positioned to capture it.`,

## 🤖 CLAUDE PROMPTS FOR DEEP DIVE ARTICLE GENERATION

### Prompt 1: Key Finding Section

```
You are writing the opening "Key Finding" section of a research article.

Given data:
- Metric A changed from X to Y (Z% change)
- During time period: [dates]
- Sample size: [N] data points

Write a 2-3 sentence "Key Finding" that:
1. States the headline number with impact
2. Frames it as a shift, not just a stat
3. Ends with "This isn't [obvious interpretation]. It's [reframing]."

Example: "Revenue grew from 0.26% to 1.84%—a 7x increase—while tickets dropped 33%. This isn't correlation. It's a fundamental shift in how support creates value."
```

### Prompt 2: Analysis Section ("What Changed?")

```
You are writing an analysis section for a CX research article.

Context:
- Old approach: [describe]
- New reality: [describe from data]
- Key data points: [list]

Write 4-6 paragraphs that:
1. Opens with the old paradigm ("For years, X was measured by...")
2. Declares it dead ("That playbook is dead.")
3. Explains what's replacing it
4. Ends with "Here's what the data shows:" followed by specific numbers

Tone: Direct, confident, no hedging. Short paragraphs. Bold statements.
```

### Prompt 3: BFCM Stress Test Section

```
You are analyzing BFCM (Black Friday/Cyber Monday) performance data.

Given:
- Pre-BFCM metric: X
- Peak BFCM metric: Y
- Post-BFCM metric: Z
- GMV during BFCM: $[amount]

Write an analysis that:
1. Frames BFCM as "the ultimate stress test"
2. Shows the numbers before/during/after
3. Interprets what the change (or lack of change) means
4. Explains why any dip isn't a failure
5. Ends with a counterintuitive insight about timing

Do NOT use hedging language. Be declarative.
```

### Prompt 4: Action Items Section

```
You are writing the "What Should You Do?" section.

Given insight: [summary]
Target reader: Ecommerce merchant

Write 4 action items using this exact format:

**If you're [doing X]:** [Action]. [Supporting statement < 25 words]

Categories to cover:
1. Measuring wrong things → measure right things
2. Using generic tools → consider specialized tools
3. Optimizing wrong moment → optimize right moment
4. Worried about scaling → don't worry

End with a memorable one-liner that captures the whole article.
```

### Prompt 5: Full Article Generation (n8n Workflow)

```
You are generating a full CX Lab research article.

Input JSON:
