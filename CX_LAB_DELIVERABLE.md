# 📊 The Two Insights That Matter

---

## 1️⃣ The Efficiency Multiplier

> 💡 **The One-Liner:** AI-influenced revenue grew 7×, but drops during peak sales. Optimize AI for uncertain shoppers, not committed buyers.

### What the graph shows
AI-influenced revenue grew from **0.26% to 1.84% of GMV**—a **7× increase**—while ticket volume dropped **33%**.

### The surprise
During Black Friday, when GMV hit $1.1B, AI influence *dropped* to 1.8%. 

**Why?** Committed buyers don't need help. AI works best when customers are uncertain, not when they're already adding to cart.

### Why merchants should care
AI isn't just deflecting tickets. It's driving revenue. But only when deployed at the right moments—discovery, comparison, hesitation. Not checkout.

---

## 2️⃣ The AI Satisfaction Gap

> 💡 **The One-Liner:** The CSAT gap is 0.8 points and isn't closing. Use AI for scale, preserve humans for moments that build loyalty.

### What the graph shows
| Channel | CSAT Score |
|---------|------------|
| Human agents | **4.48** / 5.0 |
| Fully automated AI | **3.77** / 5.0 |
| **The Gap** | **0.8 points** |

This gap hasn't closed in 11 months.

### The surprise
AI handover rates improved (67% → 51%), meaning AI completes more tickets independently. But customers rate those completions **lower**. 

Solving the problem ≠ resolving the experience.

### Why merchants should care
Every automation decision trades scale for experience. The winning brands aren't closing the gap—they're designing around it.

**AI for volume. Humans for loyalty.**

# ⚙️ The System Behind It

## Tools Used
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Cursor + Claude | AI pair programming, content |
| React + Recharts | Interactive data viz |
| Framer Motion | Animations |
| Vercel | Deployment |

## Workflow
```
SQL data → JSON → React charts → Claude narrative → Deploy
```

## n8n Automation
```
Weekly SQL → Transform → LLM insights → Git → Auto-deploy → Slack → Social
```

## What Breaks First (Honest)
1. Manual data exports need warehouse connection
2. AI content gets generic without human review
3. Translation always lags
