All adjustments are text/narrative updates based on feedback. Queries and visualizations remain unchanged.

---

## Quick Reference

### Critical Issues (Fix Before Launch)
1. **Ticket Volume Clarification** - Add "(AI + Human combined)" to all mentions
2. **Quality Claims Need Data Backing** - Add data analysis OR disclaimer
3. **Acknowledge Platform Improvements** - Revise "no major product changes" claim

### Important Issues (Should Fix)
4. **Missing Macro "Why"** - Add conversational commerce connection
5. **Launch Day Timing** - Use peak times for primary channels
6. **Reddit Strategy** - Switch to value-first approach (AMA or data share)

### Nice to Have (Can Improve)
7. **Press Outreach** - Add to pre-launch
8. **Examples Needed** - For Reddit AMA, podcast strategy, newsletter features
9. **AI Avatar Strategy** - Clarify: real person or generic AI, not CEO clone

## Feedback 0: Cost-Cutter Claim Reframe (RESOLVED)

### Screenshot Reference
**Location:** Graph 1 - "Why merchants should care" section
**Feedback Source:** Alessandro Montelli
**Timestamp:** 5h ago

### Feedback Content
> "The graph doesn't address how AI is cutting costs. It's true AI is a cost cutting tool (for a good portion of brands), we just need to make sure we show that to sustain the claim"

### Resolution Applied ✅
**Approach:** Option B - Reframe as efficiency + revenue (backed by ticket volume data)

**Previous text:**
```
"This proves AI isn't just a cost-cutter—it's a **revenue driver**. If AI can influence 1.8% of GMV while handling 33% fewer tickets, your support team can focus on high-value conversations that close sales."
```

**Updated text:**
```
"This proves AI delivers on both fronts—**efficiency** and **revenue**. Ticket volume dropped from 3.3M to 2.2M monthly (33% reduction) while AI-influenced revenue grew 7x. Your support team can focus on high-value conversations that close sales."
```

**Data backing:**
- Monthly Ticket Evolution: 3.3M tickets/month (2024) → 2.2M tickets/month (2025) = 33% reduction

**Status:** ✅ Updated in Notion document

---

## Feedback 1: Ticket Volume Clarification

### Screenshot Reference
**Location:** Graph 1 - "The Efficiency Multiplier" section
**Feedback Source:** Alessandro Montelli
**Timestamp:** 5h ago

### Feedback Content
> "@K M would this be all tickets, just AI-tickets or just human-tickets? would be good to clarify as the report tries to navigate this hybrid approach narrative"

### Current State
- The graph shows "ticket volume dropped 33%" but doesn't specify:
  - All tickets (AI + Human)?
  - Only AI tickets?
  - Only Human tickets?

### Justification
**Why this matters:**
- The insight claims "tickets ↓33% while revenue ↑3,470x"
- If this refers to ALL tickets, it's more impactful
- If it's only AI or only Human tickets, the narrative changes
- The "hybrid approach" (AI + Human) narrative needs clarity

### Recommended Adjustments

#### 1. Add Clarification in Graph Description
**Current:**
```
"Monthly GMV alongside AI-influenced revenue rate. Fewer tickets, more impact per interaction."
```

**Improved:**
```
"Monthly GMV alongside AI-influenced revenue rate. Total support tickets (AI + Human combined) decreased 33% while revenue influence grew 7x."
```

#### 2. Update "What the graph shows" Section
**Current:**
```
"AI-influenced revenue grew from 0.26% to 1.84% of GMV—a 7x increase—while ticket volume dropped 33%."
```

**Improved:**
```
"AI-influenced revenue grew from 0.26% to 1.84% of GMV—a 7x increase—while total support ticket volume (AI + Human combined) dropped 33%."
```

#### 3. Add Methodology Note
**Add to methodology section:**
```
"Ticket Volume: Total customer service inquiries per month, including both AI-handled and human-handled tickets."
```

## Feedback 2: Quality Improvement Claims

### Screenshot Reference
**Location:** Section 2 - "The surprise" and Section 3 - "Why merchants should care"
**Feedback Source:** Alessandro Montelli (3 comments)
**Timestamp:** 5h ago

### Feedback Content

#### Comment 1:
> "@K M this isn't necessarily true, the p&e team has been focusing on improving quality for most of H2 which has come into fruition with the updated agentic architecture, amongst other changes. Not saying you would've known this of course, but need to be wary of unsustained claims"

#### Comment 2:
> "@K M how do we know this is true? do we have any insight on merchants who updated their KBs vs those who didn't?"

#### Comment 3:
> "@K M do we know if the 8+ points in quality came from merchants who optimized their AI Agent?"

### Current State
**Claims made:**
1. "Quality improved **without major product changes**"
2. "**merchants who invested in their knowledge base saw the biggest gains**"
3. "AI quality is a function of effort, not magic"
4. "Merchants who train their AI see 8+ point quality gains"

### Justification
**Why this matters:**
- Internal team (P&E) has been working on quality improvements (H2 focus)
- Updated agentic architecture may have contributed
- Claims about KB investment need data backing
- 8+ point quality gain needs attribution proof

### Recommended Adjustments

#### 1. Revise "Quality Improved" Claim
**Current:**
```
"Quality improved **without major product changes**—**merchants who invested in their knowledge base saw the biggest gains.**"
```

**Improved (Option A - More Accurate):**
```
"Quality improved from 77% to 85%—**merchants who invested in their knowledge base saw the biggest gains**, alongside platform improvements in H2 2025 including updated agentic architecture."
```

**Improved (Option B - Conservative):**
```
"Quality improved from 77% to 85%. Multiple factors contributed: merchant knowledge base investment, platform improvements, and updated agentic architecture in H2 2025."
```

#### 2. Add Data Backing for KB Claims
**Add new section (If Data Available):**
```
**Data Analysis:**
- Merchants with KB updates (n=XX) vs. without (n=XX)
- Quality score comparison: KB-optimized merchants vs. baseline
- Average quality improvement: 8+ points for active optimizers
```

**If data not available:**
```
**Note:** KB investment correlation analysis based on merchant feedback. Quantitative analysis pending. Current claim based on qualitative feedback from high-performing merchants.
```

#### 3. Revise "8+ Point Quality Gains" Claim
**Current:**
```
"Merchants who train their AI see 8+ point quality gains."
```

**Improved (If Data Available):**
```
"Merchants who actively optimize their AI Agent (knowledge base updates, intent training) see quality score improvements averaging 8+ points."
```

**Improved (If Data NOT Available):**
```
"Merchants who actively optimize their AI Agent see quality score improvements. Based on qualitative feedback from high-performing merchants."
```

**Add methodology (If Available):**
```
**Methodology:** Based on analysis of merchants who made 5+ KB updates in Q3-Q4 2025 vs. baseline merchants.
```

#### 4. Acknowledge Platform Improvements
**Update "Why merchants should care" section:**
```
"AI technology is no longer experimental—it's mature. The 77% → 85% jump reflects both merchant optimization efforts and platform improvements, including updated agentic architecture in H2 2025. AI can now deliver consistent, reliable customer experiences. Now is the right time to adopt. Brands waiting for "better AI" are already behind."
```

#### 5. Revise "The Flywheel" Box
**Current:**
```
"Better KB → Better AI responses → Higher quality scores → More investment → Better KB"
```

**Updated (More Accurate):**
```
"Better KB + Platform Improvements → Better AI responses → Higher quality scores → More investment → Better KB + Continued Platform Evolution"
```

## Feedback 3: Macro-Level "Why" Missing

### Screenshot Reference
**Location:** Graph showing AI Agent Resolution Growth
**Feedback Source:** Alessandro Montelli
**Timestamp:** 5h ago

### Feedback Content
> "i think if we had the "why" as to why this is happening at a macro level this could then be tied back to conversational commerce"

### Current State
**Current narrative:**
- "AI Agent resolved tickets grew from 150K to 320K (+113%)"
- "AI now handles 38% of all tickets, up from 19%"
- Focuses on WHAT happened, not WHY

### Justification
**Why this matters:**
- Explains the underlying trend (not just numbers)
- Connects to broader industry shift (conversational commerce)
- Makes insight more valuable and actionable
- Helps merchants understand the macro context

### Recommended Adjustments

#### 1. Add "Why This Is Happening" Section
**Add new section after the graph:**
```
**Why this is happening:**
- **Conversational commerce shift:** Ecommerce brands are moving from transactional support to revenue-generating conversations
- **AI maturity:** LLM improvements in 2024-2025 made AI viable for complex queries
- **Cost pressure:** Customer acquisition costs rising → brands optimizing support operations
- **Scale necessity:** At 25M+ monthly tickets, human-only support isn't scalable
```

#### 2. Connect to Conversational Commerce
**Add to narrative:**
```
"The 113% growth in AI-resolved tickets reflects a broader shift toward conversational commerce—where customer service becomes a revenue channel, not just a cost center. AI enables this by handling volume while maintaining quality."
```

#### 3. Update "Quick Take"
**Current:**
```
"AI Agent resolved tickets grew from 150K to 320K (+113%) while total ticket volume stayed flat."
```

**Improved:**
```
"AI Agent resolved tickets grew from 150K to 320K (+113%) while total ticket volume stayed flat. This reflects the industry's shift toward conversational commerce—where AI handles scale, enabling support to become a revenue channel."
```

## Feedback 4: Press & Backlink Strategy

### Screenshot Reference
**Location:** Phase 1 - Pre-Launch Playbook
**Feedback Source:** Maxime Sutra
**Timestamp:** 5h ago

### Feedback Content
> "Do you have an example?"
> "I'm curious how you handle that. Can you check if it is doable via the API?"

**Context:** Discussion about using Ahrefs to find backlinks of competitors/partners, identify media, and notify them in advance.

### Current State
- Pre-launch playbook focuses on influencers, podcasts, teasers
- No mention of press outreach or backlink strategy

### Justification
**Why this matters:**
- Press coverage = broader reach
- Backlink strategy = SEO value
- Competitor analysis = better positioning
- Media relationships = long-term value

### Recommended Adjustments

#### 1. Add Press Outreach to Pre-Launch
**Update Day -12:**
```
**Day -12:**
- **Action:** "Send embargoed preview to top 5 influencers + 10 tech/CX journalists"
- **Owner:** "Me + PMM"
- **Output:** "Exclusive first look" email + press list"
```

#### 2. Add Backlink Research Task
**Add new task:**
```
**Day -10:**
- **Action:** "Research competitor/partner backlinks via Ahrefs API, identify target media"
- **Owner:** "Me + SEO team"
- **Output:** "Target media list with backlink context"
```

#### 3. Add Press Release
**Add to Launch Day:**
```
**9:00 AM:** "Blog post live on Gorgias.com/blog"
**9:01 AM:** "Press release distributed to tech/CX media"
```

### Implementation Notes
- Check Ahrefs API availability for backlink research
- Create press release template

## Feedback 5: Launch Day Timing Strategy

### Screenshot Reference
**Location:** Phase 2 - Launch Day Schedule
**Feedback Source:** Alessandro Montelli & Maxime Sutra
**Timestamp:** 5h ago

### Feedback Content

#### Alessandro:
> "@K M is there a reason why we'd benefit with posting sequentially rather than posting at peak usage times for all channels?"

#### Maxime:
> "Any example that you found successful? Usually people don't like self-promotion on Reddit, but curious to get your take."

### Current State
**Current schedule:**
- Sequential posting (9:00 AM, 9:05 AM, 9:10 AM, etc.)
- Reddit posts at 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM
- No mention of peak usage times

### Justification
**Why this matters:**
- Peak usage times = maximum visibility
- Sequential posting may reduce reach (algorithmic timing)
- Reddit self-promotion = community backlash risk
- Need examples of successful Reddit strategies

### Recommended Adjustments

#### 1. Revise Launch Day Schedule
**Current:**
```
9:00 AM: Blog post
9:05 AM: CEO LinkedIn
9:10 AM: Company LinkedIn
9:15 AM: Twitter/X
9:30 AM: Email customers
```

**Improved (Peak Times Strategy):**
```
**Timing Strategy:**
- Primary channels (LinkedIn, Twitter) at peak usage times for maximum visibility
- Sequential posting allows for cross-channel amplification
- Balance: Peak times for primary, sequential for amplification

**Morning Peak (9:00-10:00 AM EST):**
- 9:00 AM: Blog post live
- 9:05 AM: CEO LinkedIn (peak LinkedIn time)
- 9:10 AM: Company LinkedIn
- 9:15 AM: Twitter/X thread (peak Twitter time)

**Mid-Day Peak (12:00-1:00 PM EST):**
- 12:00 PM: Email to customers (lunch break engagement)
- 12:30 PM: Reddit r/ecommerce (if valuable discussion, not self-promo)

**Afternoon Peak (2:00-4:00 PM EST):**
- 2:00 PM: Email to prospects
- 3:00 PM: Reddit r/shopify (if valuable discussion)
- 4:00 PM: Engage with comments
```

#### 2. Reddit Strategy Revision
**Current:**
```
12:00 PM: "Reddit r/ecommerce post"
2:00 PM: "Reddit r/shopify post"
```

**Improved:**
```
**Reddit Strategy (Value-First, Not Self-Promo):**
- Format: AMA - "We analyzed 600M support tickets. Ask us anything."
- OR: Data share - "Here's what we learned from 600M ecommerce support tickets [data]"
- Timing: Post during subreddit peak hours (check r/ecommerce and r/shopify analytics)
- Engagement: Respond to every question quickly
- Risk: Skip Reddit if self-promo risk is high

12:00 PM: Reddit r/ecommerce AMA (if valuable discussion, not self-promo)
2:00 PM: Reddit r/shopify data share (if valuable discussion)
```

#### 3. Add Timing Rationale
**Add note:**
```
**Timing Strategy Rationale:**
- Sequential posting allows for cross-channel amplification (people see on LinkedIn, then share on Twitter)
- Peak times maximize initial visibility
- Balance: Use peak times for primary channels, sequential for amplification
```

### Examples Needed
- Successful Reddit AMA examples in ecommerce/CX space
- Reddit data-sharing posts that gained traction
- Timing analysis of successful Reddit posts
